# Complex YOLO 

a PyTorch implementation of the [Complex YOLO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06199.pdf) model with uncertainty for object detection in 3D.  
code is inspired by and builds on existing implementations of Complex YOLO [implementation of 2D YOLO] [YOLO33](https://github.com/Yuanchu/YOLO3D)   (https://github.com/marvis/pytorch-yolo2) and [sample Complex YOLO implementation](https://github.com/AI-liu/Complex-YOLO).
